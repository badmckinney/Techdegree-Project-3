# Techdegree-Project-3  --  Interactive Form

This app creates interactivity between the form and the user.
It accomplishes this by:
1) Validating all input fields
2) Providing visual indication of fields containing an error
3) Providing helpful error messages based on existing error
4) Consolidating relevant information based on user input

The app was written, purely, in JavaScript; making it unobtrusive.
